  <h2>Itinerary</h2>
  <p>We will be married in a private service on Saturday evening. We know some people may be disappointed to not be in attendance for the ceremony, but we humbly ask for your understanding and support. We look forward to seeing everyone at the after party and reception.</p>
  <p>We hope that our family and friends will spend Saturday with one-another, catching-up and exploring Baltimore, the city we have made our home. On the center spread you’ll find a list of our favorite shops, restaurants and sights.</p>

  <h2>Accomodations</h2>
  <p>We have a block reserved at the <a href="https://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/maryland/baltimore/hotel-revival-baltimore">Hotel Revival</a> in Mt. Vernon. You can book a room via <a href="http://bit.ly/a-h-hotel">this link</a> or by calling (410) 727-7101. If the block is fully booked, or you’d prefer to stay elsewhere, there are many other hotels in the city that can accomodate you. We recommend staying in one of the following neighborhoods and avoiding the Inner Harbor:</p>
  <h3>Mt Vernon</h3>
  <p>This neighborhood is where we had our first apartment together. It has great restaurants, bars, and museums, and is within walking distance of the Station North Arts District. Wet City, the venue for the after party, is located here.</p>

  <h3>Fells Point</h3>
  <p>We separately lived in Fells Point in our years after college. It was the location of our first date and features lots of live music, food, and bars. This is a great place to stay if you’re looking for active night-life and don’t mind a little noise. You can even take the Water Taxi across the harbor to the reception on Sunday.</p>
